# Horiseon webpage refactor

The goal of this refactor is to clean up the code, making it easier to maintain going forward.  

## Motivation
In addition to making the code more manageable, a big motivation for my changes is to make the site meet accessiblity standards, allowing **EVERYONE** the ability to follow along the webiste.

### Lessons Learned
This project helped me gain a better understanding of html, css, and how they work together.  One new thing I learned was how to add anchor tags to my document and link them menu items within the document.  Furthermore, I learned about commenting a CSS document.
