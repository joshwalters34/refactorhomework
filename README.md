# refactorhomework

changes I made to refactor the code
- gave the site a title of "Horiseon"
- updated class="header" to a header tag
- updated class="footer" to a footer tag
- changed class of seo to an id since it's one of a kind
- updated the span in the main header to include the color change, rather than create a class.  Also removed the seo class from the css
-  in CSS document I took out "header" before h1 tag
- in CSS document I took out "header" & "h1" before .seo tag
- in CSS document I took out "header" & "div" before ul tag
- in CSS document I took out "header", "div", & "ul" before li tag
- removed the header div section in the css and added the styling to ul and removed teh div tags within the header
- changed the div with class name of hero to an image tag with id of hero, since img tag makes more sense.  And I changed to an id because this is the only image using this style
- added alt description for the images
- cleaned up the image tags for the images in right sidebar
