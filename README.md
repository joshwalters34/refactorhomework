# Horiseon webpage refactor

The goal of this refactor is to clean up the code, making it easier to maintain going forward. Updates were made to classes, IDs, and unneeded div tags were removed.  In addition, anchor tags were added and linked to the menu items in the top right and alt attributes were added to all images to improve accessiblity. 


## Motivation
In addition to making the code more manageable, a big motivation for my changes is to make the site meet accessiblity standards, allowing **EVERYONE** the ability to follow along the webiste.  As we move forward, it will be vital that we make websites accessible to anyone that needs it.


## Lessons Learned
This project helped me gain a better understanding of html, css, and how they work together.  I enjoyed making some minor switches to flexbox styleing and getting practice with it.  One new thing I learned was how to add anchor tags to my document and link them to menu items within the document.  Furthermore, I learned about commenting a CSS document.


## Why does this project stand out?

```
Below is a list of updates that make my project stand out. 
* Gave the site a concise, informational title
* Added alt atribute tags to make the site more accessible
* Updated class tags to header and footer tabs to help the code follow a logical structure
* Combined multiple class tags into 1 class tag to make the code more manageable
* Incorporated flex box styling to make the code more manageable
* Organized the CSS document and added comments so that it will be easier to navigate
